# AllStocksAnalysis
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose is to reflect some techniques to improve the development of macros using Excel and VBA. To do this, it was used a dataset in excel named AllStockAnalysis where it was performed the logic to anwer how actively can be a set of stocks and the real value of every stock in the years 2017 and 2018. Particularly, the client required the total daily volume and the yearly return of all of the stocks.

##Results:
